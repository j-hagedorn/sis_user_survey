<div id="summary" class="section level1">
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>This paper is both a summary of feedback regarding the use of data from the <em>Supports Intensity Scale (SIS®)</em> and a white paper endorsing potential uses of the information in practice. The content is a compilation of feedback from various <a href="#contributors">contributors</a>, including statewide focus groups, respondents to an online survey, and review by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Administration (MDHHS-BHDDA).</p>
<p>As the completion of the initial round of SIS® assessment draws near, questions remain about the opportunities for use of this information in practice. This detailed dataset has applications for people in a number of different roles: <em>the Person receiving services, Supports Coordinator, Program Director, Assessor Supervisor, SIS Assessor or Quality Lead, Advocate, Utilization Management, Community Living Supports, HSW Manager, and more</em>. Furthermore, each of these roles may have a different set of uses for the information.</p>
<p>Several broad areas for use of the data were identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <a href="#use_pcp">Person-Centered Planning</a></li>
<li>in <a href="#use_manage">Benefit Management</a></li>
<li>to <a href="#access">Assure Service Access and Equity</a></li>
<li>to <a href="#use_pop">Understand Population-level Needs</a></li>
<li>in <a href="#use_advoc">Advocacy efforts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While the specific application of the data should not fall into any of the <a href="#inappropriate">specific ways in which SIS® data cannot be used</a> (<em>identified by MDHHS-BHDDA in published guidance</em>) the department endorses the use of assessment data to inform each of the areas outlined here.</p>
<p>Contributors also identified additional issues that impact the implementation of this data in practice. These issues include <a href="#communication">communication</a>, <a href="#aspects">aspects of the tool and related data</a>, the <a href="#time">timeline</a> for completion, and <a href="#groups">collaboration between groups</a>. Each of these issues has some bearing on how the data is interpreted and implemented as part of decision-making processes.</p>
<p>While the deadline for completion of the initial round of SIS® assessments is quickly approaching, the use of the resulting information is still in its early development. This paper is offered as a basic foundation on which multiple positive uses can be built.</p>

<div id="context-and-purpose" class="section level1">
<h1>Context and Purpose</h1>
<p>The Supports Intensity Scale (SIS®) is a standardized assessment tool required by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS-BHDDA) for all Medicaid-eligible persons 18 and older who have intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) and who are currently receiving case management or supports coordination or respite-only services through the public behavioral health system. Use of the tool began in June of 2014, with the PIHP contractual requirement to have all eligible individuals assessed by September 30th, 2017.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the completion of this initial implementation phase, MDHHS-BHDDA sought feedback from people receiving services and supports, their family members, advocates, Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan (PIHP) employees, Community Mental Health (CMH) agencies and service providers regarding individuals’ experience with the SIS® assessment as well as current and potential uses of the data from the tool.</p>
<p>This document is intended to accomplish two objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a summary of feedback from individuals who participated in the survey and/or focus groups.</li>
<li>Provide guidance regarding potential uses of the data from the SIS® assessment tool by stakeholders in multiple roles throughout Michigan’s behavioral health system.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="contributors" class="section level1">
<h1>Contributors</h1>
<p>The guidance and thinking presented here is the result of substantial input from across the behavioral health system. Contributions were made in the following ways…</p>
<div id="focus-groups" class="section level2">
<h2>Focus Groups</h2>
<p>A series of focus groups were scheduled throughout the state for individuals with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities, their family members, and their Supports Coordinators/Case Managers. The purpose of these focus groups was to understand people’s current use of data from the SIS® and to understand how information gathered during the assessment might be used to inform the Person-Centered Planning process, ensuring that individuals receive supports and services according to their needs.</p>
<p>Four focus groups were offered at locations throughout the state (<em>in Detroit, Petoskey, Kalamazoo, and Mount Pleasant</em>) in order to reach a broad audience while minimizing travel time for attendees. <a href="#focuscomments">Focus group feedback</a> was captured in notes taken during the groups and subsequently grouped into related themes to inform this paper. Participants in the Winter 2017 Self Determination Conference were also engaged in a focus group session and their responses are included here as well.</p>
<p>A total of 133 people attended these focus groups.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Attendees included individuals receiving services, family members, advocates, peer mentors, supports coordinators, program directors, PIHP employees, SIS assessors, and others.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<h2>Survey</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Preview/?sm=O_2BNG1KDfFzgrTWySDftS7l01lFo5CEw11Po46B_2FKYGej_2FudfAYH_2BPr0I3SK4VNAg">An electronic survey</a> was developed and sent by MDHHS-BHDDA staff via e-mail to each of the following groups on February 1, 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advocates and Advocacy Organizations</li>
<li>Habilitation Support Waiver Leads</li>
<li>SIS® Assessors and Quality Leads</li>
<li>CEOs of CMHSPs and PIHPs (<em>for distribution to IDD staff</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A reminder e-mail was distributed on March 14, 2017 in advance of the closing of the survey on March 17, 2017.</p>
<p>The survey gathered feedback from users in various roles regarding their experience with the tool and its implementation in Michigan as well as their current and potential future uses of the SIS® assessment data.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>345 people responded to the survey from 127 locations across the state of Michigan. When asked which role best described their involvement in services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities in Michigan, the respondents identified as follows:</p>

<p>By far, the largest role represented in the responses is Supports Coordinator (n = 222), followed by directors of programs for IDD (n = 68) and SIS® assessors (n = 28). All other roles had fewer than 10 responses.</p>
<p>Since Supports Coordinators are a crucial part of helping to translate an individual’s assessed needs into a dialogue to inform person-centered planning and eventually authorizations for services, it is encouraging to have such a strong response in this area. The high response rate of program directors (n = 68) is also encouraging, especially with regards to potential use of the assessment data to <a href="#use_manage">manage networks of providers</a> and their programs.</p>

<p>Responses indicate that the most common use of SIS® data is to inform the individual plan of service (IPOS) and related tasks. This is not surprising, given the large number of responses from Supports Coordinators.</p>
<p>Certain uses of the assessment have been engaged more actively in respondents’ current practice. For example, the use of the information from the assessment to identify potential goals for person-centered planning had a greater number of respondents indicating <em>current</em> use than <em>potential</em> use. On the other hand, many fewer respondents indicated that they were <em>currently</em> using the data to identify new locations to make services available, though a number of respondents endorsed this as a <em>potential</em> use.</p>
</div>
<div id="role" class="section level3">
<h3>Current uses of data by role</h3>
<p>One of the principles informing the questions on the survey was that uses of the data could be meaningfully grouped by the role of the individual using the data. For instance, while it would be inappropriate for a supports coordinator to use solely SIS® data to determine medical necessity for an individual’s services, it may be entirely appropriate for a provider network manager to use the data to explore whether there are enough services in a given area to meet the needs of the entire population served. The <em>role</em> which is using the data, and the <em>use</em> to which it is put, matters.</p>
<p>The visual below provides a summary of how survey respondents in specific roles indicated they were using the data. In the chart, a darker blue means that a higher percent of respondents indicated they were currently using the data for a particular purpose or could potentially use the information for that purpose.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>We should note that this summary does not pretend to list all of the potential users or uses of this information. It is likely that many potential uses were not identified in the survey responses. As with any resource, data can be used for ingenious and unpredictable purposes. For this reason, it is important that there be principles to guide the use of this data across the system.</p>
<p>These principles will be embodied in various specific uses, and various stakeholders noted the need for specific uses to be identified to support their implementation of the the information in practice. The request by this focus group participant was echoed multiple times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Will you publish other ways it can be used? One of reasons I’m here is to look at ways across the board. We’re looking for innovation in how we can use the information.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The specific uses outlined in the next several sections identify promising areas for use of this information across various roles and areas of the behavioral health system in Michigan.</p>

<h2>Use in Person-Centered Planning</h2>
<div id="specific-types-of-use" class="section level3">
<h3>Specific Types of Use</h3>
<p>Since person-centered planning (PCP) is central to the entire system of services and supports, it has multiple steps and participants involved. Thus, there are a number of distinct uses for assessment data within the person-centered planning process.</p>
<p>Assessment data might be used in the following ways to support person-centered planning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommend individual support needs to inform an individualized plan of service (IPOS)</li>
<li>Identify potential goals and objectives for inclusion in the IPOS</li>
<li>Identify potential referrals for additional assessments or relevant services</li>
<li>Help guide safety planning by identifying areas of risk</li>
<li>Design an individualized menu of services to support an individual to live independently in the community</li>
<li>Identify individual strengths for inclusion in the IPOS</li>
<li>Provide guidance regarding supports which may provide alternatives to guardianship</li>
<li>Identify areas of specific personal interest or areas on which the individual wishes to focus</li>
</ul>

<p>The majority of survey respondents endorsed the SIS® assessment as having usefulness as a part of the PCP process (<em>either current or potential</em>) across each of the areas indicated, from identifying needs and related goals to recommending potential services for supporting those goals.</p>
<p>The chart above indicates that there is already some use of this assessment data to support the PCP process, but that this is not yet widespread even among respondents who indicated that the data could be useful in this regard. These findings from the survey were echoed in the focus group dialogues, where responses ranged from <em>“SIS doesn’t come up in person-centered planning.”</em> to <em>“I can readily access it… review it [and] use it in the PCP process”</em>.</p>
<p>The chart below shows responses specifically from supports coordinators regarding their use of information from the assessment during the PCP process.</p>

<p>Here we see that over 60% of supports coordinators responding to the survey use the SIS® either <em>Never</em> or only <em>Occasionally</em> for any of the activities indicated here. When asked why they did not use it more frequently, these respondents articulated a number of issues related to the usefulness of the tool and its integration into the existing PCP process which should prompt a thoughtful reconsideration of current practice.</p>
<p>If one thinks of supports coordinators who are already using the assessment in the PCP process (i.e. those responding <em>Current</em>) as early adopters, the question for the broader system becomes how to spread the learning of that group to the rest of those who see the potential relevance of the tool (i.e. those responding <em>Potential</em>) and ultimately to demonstrate the usefulness of the assessment for those who did not originally see its potential (i.e. those who did not endorse either <em>Current</em> or <em>Potential</em> use).<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="considerations" class="section level3">
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>A number of helpful considerations related to this use of the data were identified by focus group attendees during their dialogues. These themes are summarized below.</p>
<div id="integration-into-process" class="section level4">
<h4>Integration into Process</h4>
<p>While the information from the assessment may have potential, making it useful in reality will require a purposeful integration of the information into the PCP process for individuals receiving services.</p>
<p>An integrated process would be one that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Summarizes relevant results</em>: Distills information from the assessment which is relevant to the individual person, rather than merely providing an abstract score (<em>too little information</em>) or a list of all question responses (<em>too much information</em>).</li>
<li><em>Makes results available</em>: The information should be easily available to those involved in the PCP process in a timely manner.</li>
<li><em>Honors individual choice</em>: The use of the information from the assessment should provide a meaningful set of options without automating the decision-making process or taking away individual control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback from focus groups consistently stressed that this integration was crucial, but was far from being the standard of practice in current person-centered planning. The excerpted feedback below attests to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It has aspects that can improve the PCP process. On the state level, we [as advocates] wanted to focus more on improving PCP process. Instead of just saying we have in law that PCP is how we drive services, if there could be a merging [of assessment data into a more consistent PCP process] that could be a beautiful thing.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“SIS doesn’t come up in person-centered planning. We’re not told as supports coordinators that we need to integrate it into the process… Only when you start talking about authorizations does the SIS come up.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We sat down for 90 minutes with a CM to make that connection. She’s the only one… that uses the SIS and aligns it with PCP. She’s tried to show new CM’s, and they’re like… well there’s just a lot that they have to do.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this integration to become a reality, several related logistical issues will need to be resolved:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consistent Integration into PCP Process</li>
<li>Consistent Integration into EMR Workflow supporting PCP Process</li>
<li>Scheduling of Assessments to Align with PCP</li>
<li>Consistent Training of Facilitators</li>
<li>Guidance Regarding Use of Data in 2nd and 3rd Year after Initial Assessment</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="benefits-of-use" class="section level4">
<h4>Benefits of Use</h4>
<p>A number of distinct benefits were identified related to the use of assessment data in the person-centered planning process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insight into individual needs and strengths for all treatment team members</li>
<li>The assessment was felt to be well aligned with the content of other assessments, and to provide support for these</li>
<li>The consistent identification of health and safety needs</li>
<li>In addition to relatively stable needs, the assessment also allows for a focus on more dynamic needs which may change over time (e.g. behavioral needs)</li>
<li>Overcoming preconceptions of family members</li>
</ul>
<p>Feedback from respondents included the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It took 7 times of hearing my client say the same thing, the assessor acknowledged it, and then it clicked for me that it was a necessary goal. [I had spent] 13 years of working with that person without having that realization.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We’re having the SIS and all this stuff is coming out about what she can do. By the time we have the PCP, the sister and consumer was able to come in and realize… if she has aspirations to do her own thing, she’s going towards that.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“A person who lives with their parent currently, being able to say ‘It’s not that I can’t cook, it’s that you don’t allow me to do things.’ …Not what’s happening right now, but what could happen.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="caveats-for-use" class="section level4">
<h4>Caveats for Use</h4>
<p>In addition to the benefits noted above, several important cautions were communicated by respondents:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Personal priorities change</em>: While the SIS® assessment allows a person to tag specific support areas as <em>“important to”</em> them, focus group participants cautioned that these items should not be interpreted as accurate indicators of a person’s current priorities, since these will naturally change with time.</li>
<li><em>Mismatch between needs and preference</em>: While the assessment identifies both support needs and individual preferences (<em>in the form of “important to” items tagged in the assessment</em>), the relationship between these is not always straightforward to interpret. For instance, a person may “need” a high level of supports in employment, but this would not be relevant for individual planning if the person was not interested in pursuing employment. On the other hand, essential safety-related items (<em>eating, for example</em>) may need to be incorporated into the person-centered planning process even if they are not explicitly endorsed by the person.</li>
</ul>
<p>As one focus group member summarized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We need to remember that the value of the information from the assessment is not a substitute for getting to know a person. There is nothing that replaces investing in other people and caring about them. To think that a tool is going to do that…it’s just not.”</em></p>

<h2>Use in Benefit Management</h2>
<div id="specific-types-of-use-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Specific Types of Use</h3>
<p>Tailoring services to the needs of a specific individual is a hallmark of person-centered planning, but there is an additional level of complexity required to support the design of provider networks to meet the precise needs of the populations they serve. Assessment data from the SIS® has been identified as having potential applications for the following activities related to benefit management:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inform the development of provider network service offerings.</li>
<li>Evaluate provider network adequacy relative to the specific needs of the population in a given area.<br />
</li>
<li>Identify locations to make services available for individuals within an accessible distance from their homes.</li>
<li>Forecast needs for services not yet available.</li>
<li>Provide consistently-formatted guidance to service providers related to the scope, duration and intensity of services authorized by the IPOS.</li>
<li>Assist providers to develop an enhanced array of services to support compliance with the HCBS Final Rule.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the majority of survey respondents endorsed the assessment as having usefulness in managing and developing a full array of benefits (<em>either current or potential</em>) across each of the areas indicated, a higher proportion marked these as <em>potential</em> uses, indicating that these applications of the data are not yet developed.</p>
<p>This was echoed in focus group dialogues, such as the provider network manager who noted that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“This could be useful when we assess… is our paneled provider [network] sufficient to meet the needs in this area?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<div id="considerations-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>A number of helpful considerations were identified by focus group attendees during their dialogues. These themes are summarized below.</p>
<div id="use-in-service-coordination-and-transitions" class="section level4">
<h4>Use in Service Coordination and Transitions</h4>
<p>The usefulness of a standardized assessment such as the SIS® to serve as a common language for coordination and transitions across providers and settings was raised consistently by focus group participants, who identified several distinct types of applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transitions between settings and services</li>
<li>Coordination of concurrent services across multiple providers</li>
<li>Transitions between supports coordinators (<em>e.g. due to employee turnover</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The statements below reinforce a growing <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=community+care+transitions">body of research</a> and <a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/improvement-initiatives/care-transitions/index.html">effort</a> surrounding coordination and transitions of care:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“They used to do SIS for all new intakes, and it was extremely helpful for supports coordinators…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For new supports coordinators, the SIS would be helpful. When I’ve known them over 10 years, I can probably help the assessor out.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If a new case manager comes on, and they have to understand their entire caseload they’ve been tasked with, they can start to understand them better with access to thorough assessments”</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="messaging-to-people-receiving-services" class="section level4">
<h4>Messaging to People Receiving Services</h4>
<p>A number of participants noted that their personal messaging to clients regarding the usefulness of the SIS® assessment included discussions about improving the relevance of services. One participant noted that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I framed [the SIS assessment to clients as a tool that] helps us to be able to provide the services you need in the future.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the current time, however, many provider networks have not yet evolved to incorporate this information into how they develop services and supports, and this can lead to frustration for individuals receiving services:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“People ask, ‘How might that help me?’ with questions related to job services, for example, when there are no services available”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be important to continue to share ways in which individual needs and interests are being considered to shape a more responsive array of services.</p>

<h3>Specific Types of Use</h3>
<p>Of all the potential uses of data from the SIS® assessment, this was one of the most commonly endorsed during focus group forums. Assessment data from the SIS® has been identified as having potential applications in the following areas related to assuring access to services and ensuring the equity of access for all persons receiving services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure people receive the services they need</li>

<div id="considerations-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Considerations</h3>
<p>A number of helpful considerations were identified by focus group attendees during their dialogues. These themes are summarized below.</p>
<div id="a-difficult-balance" class="section level4">
<h4>A Difficult Balance</h4>
<p>While stakeholders consistently endorsed the goal of improving access to services, there was an acknowledged complexity in ensuring that access was distributed equally within budgetary constraints.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, there were four different types of decisions that participants alluded to in relation to service access:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renew access (<em>Continue access to existing service/benefit</em>)</li>
<li>Identify need (<em>Facilitate access to new service/benefit</em>)</li>
<li>Deny request (<em>Prevent access to new service/benefit</em>)</li>
<li>Remove access (<em>Remove access to existing service/benefit</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, the latter two types of decisions were of greater concern to participants, whose primary concern is with individual people and not with budgets. However, participants also acknowledged the tension that a disposition toward the first two decision types will tend to use up available resources more quickly.</p>
<p>Respondents from various roles acknowledged this tension when describing their current uses and future hopes for information from the tool to assure access and equity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I know our SIS assessor always makes it a point to say, this does not decrease services, but could add extra emphasis as to why they do or don’t need a service.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“[We] have had people bring up the SIS score when it doesn’t jive with the level of services being requested.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We use [the SIS results] as a talking point to talk about prioritizing our Hab Support Waiver spots. It isn’t an end-all, but helps us to prioritize.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“As new people come in, we have a chance to give equality of service for similar level of needs. And wherever they might go, they’ll be able to see that they have the tool completed and understand that level of need.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When I know that the SIS is going to be compiled and go to money-makers… there’s people at the local level that can allocate resources in a more independent way…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There are conflicting mindsets that are trying to be balanced: We have this pot of money and we need to distribute it vs. we need to provide what is needed to the population.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tension between access and equity is common in areas of life where individual use of a limited, shared resource may have unanticipated negative effects on the community as a whole (<em>i.e. areas which fit the economic description of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the unmanaged commons</a></em>). Fortunately, there are well-developed <a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S1414-753X2002000100002&amp;script=sci_arttext#tabela1">principles for managing common resources</a><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> and these have been applied to the specific, regulated resources of <a href="http://www.rwjf.org/en/culture-of-health/2013/08/right_privilege_or.html">healthcare spending</a><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h3>Specific Types of Use</h3>
<p>In distinction from uses of the data discussed above, such as access and person-centered planning, this section pertains to uses of data which are especially relevant at the state and PIHP level. Assessment data from the SIS® has been identified as having potential applications in the following areas related to population needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand different needs across population</li>
<li>Predict costs</li>
<li>Identify impact of losing natural supports due to an aging population of parents</li>

<p>Advocates and others identified an array of potential uses of the data for advocacy purposes, both at the individual level and the population level:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We advocate for individuals with I/DD, [and] while we don’t typically sit in on SIS, it helps us to articulate and understand their situation”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The SIS… was brought up in a Fair Hearing, and it allowed to increase services. That’s an advocacy tool use. Went all the way up the chain with it.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="inappropriate" class="section level2">
<h2>Ways Data Cannot be Used</h2>
<p>Since the initial implementation of the SIS® assessment, MDHHS-BHDDA has clarified several uses of the resulting data which are not permitted.<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>As an arbitrary methodology for determining the amount, scope, and duration of community living supports and skill building services implemented outside of a person-centered planning process.</li>
<li>As a means for achieving budget reductions.</li>
<li>As a process which supplants use of medical necessity criteria for evaluating the need for community living supports, skill building, and other supports and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>While these principles have been communicated in MDHHS-BHDDA guidance, focus group participants indicated concern that these inapproriate uses still occurred. The quotes below indicate how this influences people’s perceptions of the data and may even incentivize the presentation of individual needs during assessments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Because there hasn’t been good guidance on what are we supposed to do now that we have the data, which leaves people to interpret it for themselves and develop grids which wrongly link a score to a specific service.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The fear [of the SIS being used to cut services] sets people up to focus on the deficits. The reality is that some CMHs have used the SIS to cut services and while the department has addressed this, it remains the case.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Feel like you have to make people sound so bad off or negatively in order to secure the necessary services, when I want to talk positively about the progress that I’ve made.”</em></p>

<h1>Related Issues</h1>
<p>While data is stored in databases and defined in specifications, the <em>meaning</em> of the data is influenced by any number of issues which include perceptions of those collecting, analyzing and disseminating the data, and how the data is explained.</p>
<p>The following sections outline various issues related to the diffusion and adoption of the SIS® assessment and the use of data derived from the assessment to inform decision-making at the individual, program, and population levels. Implementation of any change is influenced by several factors:<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#communication">communication channels</a></li>
<li><a href="#aspects">aspects of the change being implemented</a></li>
<li><a href="#time">time</a></li>
<li><a href="#groups">relationships between stakeholder groups</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these factors is addressed below, using feedback gathered from both the survey and focus groups.</p>
<div id="communication" class="section level2">
<h2>Communication and Messaging</h2>
<p>The use of standard assessment information is an innovation that is being implemented between multiple people and organizations. For this reason, communication is crucially important. This communication includes both official written communication and training from MDHHS-BHDDA as well as informal communication between various individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that, during the focus groups, respondents did not draw a clear line between the official messaging provided by MDHHS-BHDDA and the informal messaging communicated within their own organizations or teams. The issues with messaging noted here reflect individual perceptions rather than a comprehensive review of formal guidance to date.<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Specific themes related to the ways in which people received and conveyed this messaging included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandated requirement</strong>: One of the most consistent messages identified by participants related to the SIS® implementation was some variation of <em>“The state’s making us do it.”</em> While requirements are needed in order to guide a change toward consistent practice around assessment, the communication of this as the primary reason for implementation underscores the need for more champions with a clearly defined message regarding the value of the innovation (*i.e. “This is why the state has prioritized this change…*). Participants also noted a lack of clarity related to whether the SIS® was required, and the implications for individuals who decline to take the assessment, despite guidance issued from MDHHS-BHDDA.<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Use in identifying goals and service planning</strong>: Participants consistently identified <a href="#use_pcp">use of the data in person-centered planning</a> as an intent of SIS® implementation, though they noted various complexities with putting this into practice.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Use to support equitable access to services</strong>: Equity was one of the primary purposes identified as a rationale for implementing a standard assessment tool. As noted in the <a href="#access">discussion above</a>, the interpretation of equity often depends upon how it impacts one’s individual experience. Accordingly, many participants stated that their initial exposure to the SIS® tool had been accompanied by a fear that it would be used to decrease their access to services. As one parent put it: <em>“I would not want it to be used to cut services that are deemed to be necessary for my daughter’s support.”</em></li>

<h2>Aspects of the Assessment &amp; Data</h2>
<div id="facilitation" class="section level3">
<h3>Facilitation</h3>
<p>One of the primary experiences which impacts the implementation and interpretation of the SIS® assessment data is the experience which they have had with facilitation of the assessment, or what has been communicated to them by others about this experience.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>240 survey respondents indicated that they had participated in a SIS® assessment and remembered their experience. These individuals were asked to respond to several questions regarding that experience, and their responses are summarized in the chart below:</p>

<p>Overall, people’s experience of the facilitation of the assessment appeared to be quite positive. The two areas which had less favorable responses had to do with the clarity of the assessment results and the contribution of the assessment process to their overall understanding of the individual being assessed.</p>
<p>That being said, it is worth noting that even in these areas the majority of respondents who had participated in a SIS® assessment indicated that the results of the assessment were clear and that they had a better understanding of the person being assessed as a result.</p>
</div>
<div id="sis_format" class="section level3">
<h3>Format of the tool</h3>
<p>Several considerations related to the structure and format of the tool itself were raised repeatedly by participants, specifically regarding the ways in which these impacted their experience of the assessment process and their understanding of the resulting data. Most of the issues noted here were part of a balanced discussion among participants, with some individuals noting difficulties of the format while others acknowledged an understanding of the reasons for these attributes of the assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The use of hypothetical questions</strong>: The most common issue noted was the use of a hypothetical scenario to cue survey responses (i.e. <em>what supports would it take if you lived independently in the community?</em>). This approach was noted to have the effect of raising discrepancies between individual or family hopes and the reality of the person’s current situation. In some instances this was perceived as empowering, while in other instances it was perceived as insulting by family members. The hypothetical format also impacts interpretation of the data, since a high level of need in a particular life area may not be require allocation of resources if the person is not currently engaging that need <em>in the community</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Required to answer all questions</strong>: Participants consistently mentioned the considerable length of the assessment, which requires that all questions be answered. The benefits of this approach are that it (<em>a</em>) allows for the collection of standardized data across all life areas for each person assessed, and (<em>b</em>) prompts discussion regarding life areas where an individual and their supports may have different perceptions. The downside of this approach was that questions were sometimes felt to be irrelevant or uncomfortable and the assessment was not adaptive to observable facts about the person (<em>e.g. asking about certain medical needs</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Focus on limitations</strong>: While acknowledging the need for an assessment to identify needs in order to support the medical necessity of services, some participants were concerned that a deficit-based approach would increase as use of the data increased. This focus on limitations was compounded by the existence of similar questions on other existing assessments. As one individual noted: <em>“We already know we can’t do stuff, why again with this?”</em>.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Unclear summary/interpretation of output</strong>: Participants noted that the summary output from the assessment was not especially informative at the individual level. One person shared that <em>“the disconnect was when we got the results back, and said, how do we use these? …there wasn’t a clear score, not sure of next steps.”</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="burden" class="section level3">
<h3>Response Burden</h3>
<p>Participants indicated that the assessment was challenging to complete based on the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time to complete each assessment</strong>: Based on the number of questions and other <a href="#sis_format">aspects of the assessment tool</a>, completion of individual assessments is a time-consuming process. The process includes not only the time period of the assessment interview itself, but time required for scheduling, travel for attendees, documentation and additional work hours needed to supplement productivity requirements for supports coordinators.</li>
<li><strong>Duplication of items from other assessments</strong>: The time invested in the assessment was compounded by the fact that many organizations have implemented the assessment without eliminating duplicative questions from other assessments, which means that individuals and their families are often asked similar questions multiple times and that data related to their responses exists in both unstructured and structured formats which cannot be easily reconciled.</li>
</ul>
<p>These issues impact the <a href="#time">time needed</a> for implementation of the assessment and use of related data across the entire population.</p>
<hr />
</div>
</div>
<div id="time" class="section level2">
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>It takes time to implement any change. As mentioned above, the SIS® tool was originally required in June of 2014 with a 3-year window for the completion of an initial assessment for all eligible individuals. This timeframe balances several factors needed for scaling up and implementing the tool:</p>
<p><em>Operational resources:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>time and resources needed to train and hire assessors</li>
<li><a href="#burden">time needed to schedule and complete assessments</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Population-level needs:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing commitment to <a href="#access">equitable access to services</a></li>
<li>External timelines for projects which <a href="#fed_reqs">require use of data related to needs</a></li>
<li>Usefulness of the tool at a population level requires completion of current assessments for a representative portion of the population</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Relevance of the tool for PCP:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Interval for reassessment relative to IPOS renewal</li>
<li>Validity of assessment results over time</li>
</ul>
<p>Providers consistently noted the current operational challenges related to meeting the required deadline, and voiced a hope that the information would be put to meaningful use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At some point, it becomes a compliance issue just to get these assessments done, and you don’t have the time to do what you want with the info. I’m here to see how we can use the data we get from the system to create something spectacular. Right now it’s almost saturation… they don’t meet somewhere in between.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="groups" class="section level2">
<h2>Collaboration Between Groups</h2>
<p>One of the most helpful aspects of the focus groups was that they brought individuals who may use the data from multiple vantage points into the same room together. As <a href="#roles">mentioned earlier</a>, different people experience this information differently depending on the role they have in the behavioral health system. This has important implications when it comes to implementing a broad-ranging change such as the use of standardized assessment data for the I/DD population.</p>
<p>While there are notable exceptions, people often choose to interact with others who have similar interests and values.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is often easier to interact with individuals with shared perspectives because they share a language and one can assume a similar set of goals. Truly diffusing a change across the broader system, however, requires engaging different groups and perspectives to introduce new ideas. Without this productive exchange, it is easy for groups of people to become siloed and for the change process to stagnate.</p>
<p>It can also lead to different perceptions regarding the purpose for a change. One example which was raised multiple times during focus groups was the perception by supports coordinators that the standardized assessment indicated a lack of trust in their current assessments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I feel like the SIS is coming behind me saying Oh, you missed a step. You weren’t thorough enough, so we’re going to give a stronger intensity scale of need.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a skilled supports coordinator’s point of view, the system-wide value of having a minimum standard of assessment may not be immediately clear. However, when supports coordinators heard the usefulness of the data to other stakeholders (<em>e.g. for consistent communication of needs, to inform new supports coordinators, or to support a standard of care</em>), they voiced a new appreciation of the value of the information.</p>
<p>Continuing to engage a diverse set of stakeholders, from individuals with I/DD to policymakers, regarding the practical implementation of this and other related information will be critical to promoting trust while pursuing positive change. This will require transparency in engaging challenging and often divisive topics to achieve commonly agreed-upon goals.</p>

organizations have more SCs than SIS assessors I don t know how people could keep up and do it before pre planning on an annual basis","We go from 70 cases to 95 within a matter of 2 months  7 12 new cases per month  The more streamlined we can get to have help from assessors to communicate to families  We ve set a coordinator in place  Something set right from assessor something we can visit  review  It  just very stressful right now to do a SIS","SIS Feedback lots of people don t want to do them in the winter in Northern Michigan  Look for holiday breaks  etc ","There is often a disconnect between respondent and staff with frequency and amount of support necessary    Staff had a struggle as respondents ","As a parent of child with DD  it would be best to tell the truth to the group we re going to talk about how fabulous your kid is  but also where there are areas of need  Some things won t pertain  but we still need to address them  If there was a preface of  there might be some areas that just don t pertain to you   because honestly it s offensive as a parent  As if you didn t care how much work I put into this child  now you re not respecting my opinions  If they would just tell the truth  it would make them more human  instead of robotic  task focused ","It would be really helpful if there s something we can give the guardians to hang on to  that says  this is what you re about to do   When we try to explain it over the phone  we re trying to go over the basics  Give them something in their hand","There was a 1 page cheat sheet from the state  that we use  On the MDHHS website","We send a letter to representative or legal guardian","Sometimes the assessor and family do not agree we ve had assessments that have stopped  As the mediator as a provider  not knowing how to facilitate the family on why they should continue  when they feel they re arguing with me and have only known them for 15 minutes","They want SC to step in and break the tie  choose a side and tell someone that they re wrong","Constant challenge as a SIS assessor when do you think the rating is a little too low or a little too high  Some families use the time as an opportunity to show off progress ","Case manager answering for the other individual  and it wasn t completely helpful accurate","If I wasn t there  I don t think they d be as truthful of the assessment for example  diminishing the need for services ","When people ask   how might that help me   with question related to job services  for example  when there are no services available","You need people around who understand the way the questions are being asked ","Working at the ARC I m a parent have participated in the SIS  but also as a clinician  We ve had the SIS done without us there  and we ve asked for it to be re done  We probably have the most up to date information about the person  so we re very involved in the day to day situations that impact them  We are very involved  I can say I don t think in all of the cases that I ve been aware of that I ve been given a choice  but it has been done without an advocate or guardian involved  and it hasn t worked out well for the person ","Any system that you use is only as good as the people who input the information into the system and the way that they perceive the individual needs  I ve know the SIS to take place with the assessor and the director from CMH  Did they know the person and ask those who work with them what their dreams are ","When people s services started getting cut  people said it was the SIS and we told them that we weren t included  I think that in some cases even guardians weren t included  I d like to see it more like the PCP process where CLS staff and other providers are involved ","Home Managers do not necessarily have access to the assessment results  yet they are the ones who keep CMs informed about what s going on with the person  If a need is not seen  it s more difficult to get it paid for ","I ve had a different  much more positive experience   It s in our EMR  CMs are required to review it and give a copy to the person  so there s a real connection for us ","I know there s been SIS s completed on people we support through Self D that we ve never been able to access or don t know how  I don t know whether there is  in our EMR  it d be cool if there was a tickler to say  there s a SIS done on this person  go check it out  It s been an assessment that has to be done  but nobody is using it","I ve never been handed a SIS  Results Report  for my son ","Where s the data  We never see that  I don t think I ve ever seen that happen during my son s life and he s 44 ","There is not consistent communication with provider agencies ","As an advocate the assessments I ve participated in are with people that I know  so that I can give additional information that maybe a SC doesn t know  depending on how long I ve known them  It s not an uncomfortable role for me  Sometimes parents participating for the first time and new to process don t know how they can speak up  disagree  getting more info from SC","As a respondent advocating and helping the person answer questions if need be  Most have been because of guardians person doesn t understand the questions","At the peer mentor retreat  we were told that the person has to be present for at least 15 minutes","I was also told that you could take breaks if it was becoming overwhelming","I think this is very good for peer mentoring  because people are often not comfortable talking to families or staff","As peer mentors we re being used to reduce anxiety","As a peer mentor  but my role also is if they re SIS assessment is coming up  and if they ask if I do it  and I can share my experiences  and tell them it s long  and you may not agree","Maybe there is something for the caseholder  but there is a level of disconnect from the SIS process","Because I ve done so many SIS s  I can help reign in a respondent  or reframe questions to help get it done ","Sometimes a passive listener  and sometimes a mediator when they assessor when the parents and supports coordinator s information doesn t match","Depends on the individual and team of people around them  I ve been through about 25 SIS s  have been a respondent  sometimes a passive listener  If I feel numbers aren t lining up  I might intervene  other times  as a mediator  Not sure it s clearly been stated ","I ve never been a passive listener  I had to be a mediator once because a family walked out right it was starting  They didn t understand that we weren t trying to put them in independent living  they were like  why are you asking these questions  they can t do it  Father didn t come back but mother did  Explained that we re not trying to make them leave their AFC  but instead how we can support them ","Double edged sword there to be helpful to the consumer for the familiar face  to proceed and provide appropriate answers to questions  Explain  they mean this when they ask you this ","Different for each situation sometimes you have to put a person in their place  or have to be a counselor  Sometimes you re mediating an argument with a SIS assessor  and it can go on for hours ","No one s ever asked their family before with  what would happen if your child was normal ","Do the SIS assessors have an opportunity to talk about ableism  I don t identify as I DD  but I identify as a woman with a disability  I want to know SIS assessors are in tune with that approach  and can address if this dialogue is uncomfortable ","SIS requires a high level of trust being completely open  tell everything to someone they don t know","Without trust in the SIS  you won t get anywhere with anyone","I become self conscious with all these assessments that show our limitations","We already know we can t do stuff  why again with this ","When it first rolled out  I was a CM  and it was explained much in that way by the trainers through MORC  but the assessor it left a sour taste in my mouth assessors used the phrase  like a normal person  ","Feel like you have to make people sound so bad off or negatively in order to secure the necessary services  when I want to talk positively about the progress that I ve made ","At some level  as people with higher functioning  we realize that assessments are a regular part of our life   If the stars aligned and the moon was right  then it probably could get better  but it s not  so then you get angry ","The SIS might be void by year 2 if the  important to for  section has changed  meanwhile PCP is fluid  while SIS is stagnant as of the day its completed ","In 3 years a lot of things can happen  Is it possible to do a SIS more frequently when there are life changes ","Some questions are very invasive  others don t seem relevant","It was well explained  but long  and I didn t mind any of the questions because I know they re just trying to get as much info as possible  but later I ve heard people say they thought the questions were too personal  and why do they ask those things if I m not at that place in my life ","For me  you sit there  and answer another set of intrusive  irrelevant questions  Being a respondent for your own SIS  having to sit through a very complex  long  intensive scale of intensity  we re looking at a very intense set of questions ","Some sections of the assessments feel pretty irrelevant  Last one I had was 80 year old woman  non verbal  and they re asking about getting a job  and we can t skip any of the sections","Can areas be skipped to make more efficiencies ","One person it changed my clinical relationship by sitting through part of the SIS  Things have changed he s refusing other services and supports that he needs  that is stuck in his mind now   In a lot of situations  if I think the questions could be moved around  it would help  Medical needs are in the beginning  and  how much time do you need to spend cleaning your tracheotomy   and it s not relevant  We can talk about clinical validity  but those are the things that start to set people off ","You need repetitive questions to keep consistency ","Going from CM to assessor  I went at least a year before I assessed anyone that had been on my caseload  I had a young man say to me that I had worked with  he said  I m not going to answer  cause you know the answer  I said  I don t know  you have to tell me  I found that the answers people gave me were different a year down the road than I expected ","I don t know if I could interpret what the output of the SIS means ","As a supports coordinator  I wouldn t know what to do with it ","It s like getting a raw IQ score  There s no legend key key so that us lay people can understand it ","It is difficult to interpret some of the questions ","Results of the SIS need to be presented in a different way to DD individuals something more user friendly results  cleaner","Preparing them for a time when I m not going to be here  Not what s happening right now  but what could happen ","I like the what ifs because I ve only been working with people with DD for 15 years  but in that time  I ve gone from seeing closures of Mt  Pleasant  and group homes  because people are able to get CLS services  able to get apartments with other people  and it s happened relatively fast for me over the past 5 years ","I participated in one with an individual who could respond on his own  He got agitated at the type of questions and how they were asked what level you would need  etc felt offensive  Might need to consider a change in the questions ","I ve heard some really negative things about it getting rolled out in our agency   comments related to consumer not knowing how to even answer the questions  so not feeling comfortable in them ","Staff that were supporting the individuals as a respondent working through a question of  like anyone their age would do  related to employment  cognitive impairments inhibiting people from normalizing situations based on age or life stage ","One of my experiences has been that for individuals completely dependent on all care  it is particularly difficult for the parents  When you re talking about employment  independence  etc   you see parents look at the assessors like  are you kidding me  Why are you even asking these questions  ","Not fair to ask about things that a person could never do   Why put families through that ","Appears insensitive  implies that parents aren t doing enough","The explanation is good  but for some of the families it s not appropriate","As an SC  I ve struggled it seems to some families that too much time is spent saying  you have to do this and get it done  but then the first half of the SIS is spent going into great details that do not seem relevant ","Explained well  but some parents are dismissive  they ll never be able to do that  or give blanket answer statements  oh yeah  they can do that  or that ","SIS is creating some discrepancies  encouraging people to dream  but if that s disconnected from what SCs think  what assessors think","As a SC  I always advocate that both parents are at the assessment to give accurate responses  Parents need to be able to untangle the work that they do for an individual from the individual s own capacity ","Long  Some of the areas are difficult for parents to process  For instance  asking parents about employment or other areas where the person is not currently active is difficult for them to answer ","etc  We haven t given them  If you answer these set of questions this way  you ll get more CLS $   but that s how people are treating it  Bottom line is most families don t want to do the SIS assessment ","Because there hasn t been good guidance on  what are we supposed to do now that we have the data   which leaves people to interpret it for themselves and develop grids which wrongly link a score to a specific service ","SIS doesn t show that you have medical need for a given service","I do quality management at the PIHP level very invested in the data but not close to it  My concern is inappropriate use  and despite lots of message  there s worry that this tool is going to reduce my services  that this score equals this authorization  I m already seeing those concerns  because it becomes part of the conversation  We re not going to give you as much CLS anymore  I can t stress that enough in how we document authorizations  I think that s going to be the soft spot how we link it  but in a way that s not intended ","There seem to be thresholds around authorizations  where people want to define medical necessity for gatekeeping  Parents think that because they ve had a number of services  I ve heard the language   the SIS score doesn t necessarily reflect what s in the authorization   This hasn t impacted services yet but it s what makes people wary ","Most of it has negatively impacted people that don t use it for PCP  Sadly  the CLS tool and SIS were used negatively to reduce services  outside of PCP process  ","I m not sure if it s used in either person centered planning or authorizations  That said  authorizations change all the time  regardless of whether a person s needs change  Whatever formula they used in the administrative side of the house  that s what they ve done  This is more of a budgetary process at the CMH level ","Assessment makes it seem like someone can do something with supports  and eliminate a need","Sometimes I was concerned about staff getting to a level of care that would support an authorization level vs  what the person was able to do or what was important for them to be able to do  Wasn t necessarily how deep they were diving  but more on their interpretation on what they could do ","Parents and guardians sometimes might not answer truthfully  We re obligated to use that key of ABE scores ","Some guardians see these as opportunistic  like  ooh  more services   and try to show off their needs to get more services","They took the SIS and assessments and didn t consult with the person receiving services ","My daughter s services were reduced by 50   We appealed it  and it was reinstated within a day  Decisions had been made based on perception of what she was capable of  Person who had never met my child did their own assessment  and came up with a number ","As an advocate  I work with all 3 MCPNs  have sat in on several SIS assessments  Experiences are diverse  Usually when I get called  it s in the middle of the process  the family isn t happy with how things are going  I try to explain what the purpose is  Families it s a lot of time  they get to the point of being angry  get frustrated by communication discrepancies  having to miss work  take kids out of school  We could improve the family s consumer s experience","I m not always involved in the initial explanations  but my experience is that it s been explained to families over the phone  don t know how well it was done","I have 23 SIS s done  and still more to do  I ve tried to pose that as new people come in  we have a chance to give equality of service for similar level of needs  And wherever they might go  they ll be able to see that they have the tool completed and understand that level of need  Presented as equity when first rolled out ","Feel like you have to make people sound so bad off or negatively in order to secure the necessary services  when I want to talk positively about the progress that I ve made ","The fear  of the SIS being used to cut services  sets people up to focus on the deficits  The reality is that some CMHs have used the SIS to cut services and while the department has addressed this it remains the case ","Just another fancy way to keep us from getting what we need or to justify a cut or change in services  How it is often perceived is out of fear ","In terms of how SIS can be used  Our goal  we have MCPN  we ve been working closely with MCPNs to ensure compliance  timely completion of the SIS  we ve been looking into in terms of clinical implications  and we ve also had parents who ask questions about if statuses will be reduced  reduction in expenses  We want to have better understanding of intent to better understand experiences  We re fully on board to ensure compliance of SIS program ","The fear as an advocate is trying to break down the situation to a point where things will be less costly  You ll find a way to break me  like   if you put me through all of this to get services  then forget it  ","As an assessor now  I still deal with the fear  and the uncommunicated message of equity  They say  my friend did this with their kid  and services were taken away  Even 2 years later  I don t think the messages are getting through  Still a perception of services linked to responses ","A lot of our people come  and it s fear based  guardians come in and they re comfortable with where their individual is at  so it becomes fear based  I m a team leaders so I have a half case load + 14 people under me  We have to do a lot of  comfort  along the way to get people to participate  Sometimes the staff and myself will sit in on the assessment to protect older guardians from fear  Some guardians have removed themselves from parts of the situation","In my experience  a lot of people say  if I don t do this  will you take my benefits away  Will my check not come  Other services being cut off  ","I would not want it to be used to cut services that are deemed to be necessary for my daughter s support ","It s a question that makes parents concerned about services being taken away from them ","Having no data  we don t know the final outcome of where we re going with the data ","Because there hasn t been good guidance on  what are we supposed to do now that we have the data   which leaves people to interpret it for themselves and develop grids which wrongly link a score to a specific service ","If it s supposed to help us  it s coming afterwards","There are conflicting mindsets that are trying to be balanced  we have this pot of money and we need to distribute it vs  we need to provide what is needed to the population","Equity of services was explained  Disconnect was when we got the results back  and said  how do we use these  Unlike LOCUS  there wasn t a clear score  not sure of next steps","I come from the finance side  and I ve heard about the assessments  but I don t know how that would affect my job  MCPN level  ","I think guidance has been unclear from Day 1  It s a new tool  we ve never had a DD tool  which is part of the reason it was brought in place  to be utilized with planning ","At some point  it because a compliance issue just to get these assessments done  and you don t have the time to do what you want with the info  I m here to see how we can use the data we get from the system to create something spectactular  Right now it s almost saturation that they don t meet somewhere in between ","Will you publish other ways it can be used  One of reasons I m here is to look at ways across the board  We re looking for innovation in how we can use the information ","A few years ago  it was rolled out  I didn t know what it was  Wasn t clear what it was at first","As a supports coordinator  I didn t get much explanation  Not that my leadership wasn t willing to do so  but I don t know if much information was provided to them about why it s needed  what is needed ","As a SIS Assessor  I explain it with a lot more detail  I started a year after the mandate came out  Originally I was trained to say  required  every 3 years  Manual says it must be completed every three years  Now I m told the results are good for 3 years  When guardians say  is this required  the manual says required  but we also know the importance of choice  In my CMH  that s where we re struggling  I have a lot of declination  much higher than other places in our region ","My first thought as a consumer was  if I don t do this  I might lose services  or not be able to be a peer mentor","It was mandated ","I don t think people are told that they can choose to not participate in the SIS  I don t think parents are being told that they can waive it or delay it","When we first started doing SIS  we had people who already had PCP ","Ideal roll out for entering the system is doing the SIS first  merge or replace them  would make so much more sense","During the Pre planning and PCP  the basic guidance from CMH documents  it s not  what d you say in the SIS  what were results I ve never been involved in PCP or preplanning and talk about the SIS  Only mentioned in passing  It s about the person  their gifts and strengths  what they ve been doing  what they want to do ","The ARC is an information we take pride in informing people about what s going on  Using our newsletter  sharing with staff  This has been challenging putting a positive spin on the SIS  It would be nice to have clear information about how this will enhance PCP process ","Difficult to explain to my consumers when they ve already had an assessment with me  Explained that everyone is doing this  your name just happened to be pulled","Another thing you might want to ask parents   families I don t know how it was introduced to families  so asking at that level  what was your first introduction to the SIS  how were you introduced  what was the elevator speech  Have heard a lot of negative experiences ","The state s making us do it mandated","As an additional tool","Initially described as mandated  you wouldn t receive services if you didn t take it  Didn t know that a person could opt out  The message that was sent out there was bye bye CMH services ","The Department had trainers around the area  so there were presentations  I think MORC  there were quite a few of those","Explained by SIS Assessor  I already knew enough about it from being a CMH employee that I don t think the SC felt the need to","For my daughter  explained as a psychosocial assessment  even though it isn t ","Person that works here as a peer mentor explained it to me a few years ago  As a peer mentor  people call me and ask what the SIS is ","I feel like the SIS is coming behind me saying  oh  you missed a step you weren t thorough enough  so we re going to give a stronger intensity scale of need  ","We ve spent the time with the people and understanding them  knowing their needs  Comes across like we re not doing something right for them to come in and  bounce the ball right ","How can a parent ask for a new assessment to be completed ","We need to remember that the value of the information from the assessment is not a substitute for getting to know a person  There is nothing that replaces investing in other people and caring about them  To think that a tool is going to do that  it s just not ","I framed it as  this helps us to be able to provide the services you need in the future ","I know our SIS assessor always makes it a point to say  this does not decrease services  but could add extra emphasis as to why they do or don t need a service ","The SIS Assessor we ve worked with has said that finances are not tied to this  that the state is going to use this to make sure that services in the future are available to meet your needs","As an assessment tool to determine level of need or level of care","I know this assessment isn t supposed to be used to determine how many hours of services you get  but to be included as part of the bigger picture  If I wasn t there  I m sure that some parents wouldn t know","Focus was  this can be used to help come up with goals and objectives for your plan","I m involved in the SIS  but I ve already done what they re doing  and my consumers say   why do we have to do this  We just answered these questions ","SC s say it s an affirmation of things that they already know  nothing outstanding that they learn ","It s a standardized assessment compared to our biospsychosocial  What s happening to our consumers is that you already had our assessment  already had a plan  and THEN they re doing a SIS  We can use the SIS data to make their plan ","People have gone through Access Screening with Common Ground  then we meet with them  then start doing PCP meeting within 14 days  then we put SIS into that  What used to take 4 5 hours ends up taking 7 8 hours  Had some resistance from families asking same questions over and over through access  assessment  and SIS  Everyone in our agency has now gone through SIS assessment  but there was initially some resistance ","We ve got through so many assessments in my son s life  and now you re asking me this again  and then the case managers are answering it ","We have people who are directly involved with SIS I think it s going well  I think it our region it s going well  Our role  and I don t have anything to do with it  but my role with quality and member experience administer surveys all the time  every day  Looking at how members are being impacted  In DTW  our members feel saturated with assessments  not just from the people who work  but the members  the families  how often they re approached on surveys  Coming back from MCI to SIS  we get these calls and conversations all the time  Your experiences with the assessment family member  person receiving services  advocate  guardian  or Supports Coordinator ","Aligning these assessments will ameliorate the situation help the process to make more sense to people  take away some of the redundancies  which reduces the time","I ve heard some really negative things about it getting rolled out in our agency time it takes to complete ","Trying to find a place ahead of time to explain the SIS  reduce amount of time it takes","Long  Some of the areas are difficult for parents to process  For instance  asking parents about employment or other areas where the person is not currently active is difficult for them to answer ","Draining process to complete  may impact validity of items completed at the end  due to tiredness ","Have trouble keeping people engaged throughout the assessment ","Right now a SIS is an obstacle for us to get beyond  There s a certain number of SIS s due before September  so we have to get about 2 done per week  plus a caseload of 70+ to take care of  I d love to see it as a more helpful tool  but right now  it s an obstacle ","Make it more user friendly and time manageable  Bring in the people doing the assessments and look at SIS for opportunities for efficiency  Seems like an assessment that you can build on ","I do try to focus on the SIS as an opportunity for your voice to be heard say what you want  what you need to be independent  Some CMs have picked up on that as an opportunity  and others have been like   What  ","Data can give people more control over their lives","I hear less positive stories than the negative ones  but I have heard some good stories about uses of the data to advocate for transportation  identify home help needs  etc ","I ve been called by two separate parents and guardians thanks for putting up with us in the SIS  because it was brought up in a Fair Hearing  and it allowed to increase services  That s an advocacy tool use  Went all the way up the chain with it ","Has been used when reviewing fair hearings","At ARC we advocate for individuals with I DD  while we don t typically sit in on SIS  it helps us to articulate and understand their situation","What I m seeing is our IPOS is kind of lined up with what SIS identifies as the needs  I know our assessments are strong enough to identify needs  If SIS has identified a goal  consumer may not have chosen to address goal  Assessments are strong enough to overlap with SIS","The supports coordinator learned a few things by doing the SIS  There are some health and safety things that pop up and get brought to attention ","Can help people plan for HCBS  services in the community","One of the most effective areas of the tool is the behavioral section helps them to know it s not lifelong ","Looking at alternatives to guardianship making decisions based on certain areas of report ","Taking some of the items where there s not a lot of support needed  turning them into strengths  and informing the PCP process ","I m also responsible for Self D in our group  I can readily access it and review it  use it in the PCP process  Not necessarily in terms of its amount scope duration  but perhaps intensity of need to help support goal of independence  We seem to be very connected ","Have had people bring up the SIS score when it  doesn t jive  with the level of services being requested ","I sat in as a witness to watch it  The gentleman that was doing it was very high need  It opened my eyes to what his needs were  It felt like a really great experience  Most of the staff knew him really well  but I learned a lot","When I took the survey  there were things I didn t know about a person","There are things that we don t know that might be brought to light","I have a lady we re doing the SIS assessment  not just out of high school  5 years after she accessed services  We re having the SIS and all this stuff is coming out about what she can do  By the time we have the PCP  the sister and consumer was able to come in and realize Dad is not the client  and if she has aspirations to do her own thing  she s going towards that  She s glad that now dad can get pressure for CM  daughter  and sister to become more independent  And the SIS supported those things ","Took 7 times of hearing my client say the same thing  the assessor acknowledged it  and then it clicked for me that it was a necessary goal  It was 13 years of working with that person without having that realization","Idea was that you d do the SIS first  then do the PCP ","It s a standardized

there was initially some resistance ","Some people have been able to get SIS done prior to pre planning  Because SIS is 3 year  and plan is annual  every time you review plan  there will be a SIS assessment to compare to and review ","SCs have obligation to monitor and review SIS hopefully you don t have to wait for assessment to come out to tell you some of these things if you have a good relationship with the people you serve","SIS doesn t come up in person centered planning  We re not told as supports coordinators that we need to integrate it into the process  That s not happening  Only when you start talking about authorizations does the SIS come up ","The pre planning piece doesn t have to be part of the SIS not the concept of the SIS  Find a way to combine processes get the information however you need to in pre planning or assessment ","In our region because we ve done it for a while  we re using it to mandate as part of pre planning process  Unless the individual refuses it  we require it before PCP to inform process  We look at areas of importance TO and FOR individual  Providers take those and address them in their person centered plan  We want to see that they re looking at that  and reviewing that ","From Day 1  there has been no direct correlation  with the PCP process   We re going to have a SIS a month before the PCP  There was no connection at all with the scheduling  You might be scheduling the PCP  and the SIS was done 1 5 years ago  When doing the survey  I was thinking about how helpful it could have been  You have to make a mental note  In my opinion  we ve been doing this a couple years now have they had one yet  is it going to be scheduled  It s difficult to remember  Right now there s no connectedness ","The SIS is really not a part of the PCP  It s something that can or will be done  or more or less a requirement  and it is information that  one of the positives  is that because it seems so frequent and often in our community ","We sat down for 90 minutes with a CM to make that connection  She s the only one I see now that uses the SIS and aligns it with PCP  She s tried to show new CM s  and they re like well there s just a lot that they have to do ","We told our workers to schedule 1 2 months prior to PCP  We use them a lot for our assessment  Health and safety we make mental notes  other areas that will carry through to the plan "," The independent facilitator  does the true PCP  and it s awesome  but at no given time to you see a document  At the same time my daughter works in the community  4 different jobs  seems capable and independent   but SIS justifies why she needs support in some places but not in others  like one job that she needs Health   Safety support  The CM can say  in this area of the SIS  this is needed   The balance is having all the knowledge in the conversation seems effortless but it s not  it s a great art ","In sitting in on a few SIS s  I find it to be a supplement to what I do as an SC  which is  create a PCP ","It has aspects that can improve the PCP process  On the state level  we wanted to focus more on improving PCP process  Instead of saying  we have in law that PCP is how we drive services   if there could be a merging  of the SIS assessment for a more consistent process  that could be a beautiful thing ","I will say that we ve had a number of SC s that after the SIS is completed  they look at plan and it complements the goals  There are folks that say  there wasn t any of this in their plan   In the future  they don t want that incorporated into their plan  despite was the SIS results say","As a SIS assessor and guardian to a family members  I had SIS filled out in my head before we started  but I was surprised to learn about how much my family member was doing ","A person who lives with their parent currently  being able to say  it s not that I can t cook  it s that you don t allow me to do things  Preparing them for a time when I m not going to be here  Not what s happening right now  but what could happen ","Can cue parents to remember to address areas that they know but have fallen by the wayside ","I love the SIS  I ve been on board since the first day it s been rolling out  I can t bill as a case manager  so my time isn t billable time  just getting paid time through my salary  The nice thing about the SIS as a case manager as we go through the SIS  I feel very validated  there s not much I need to do  because I ve already been doing these things before the SIS even started  SIS assessor reminds us that it s about what you can do with everyone else in a peer group  not their disabled peer group ","We ve had so many SIS s  after a while  I started to see as your sitting through the SIS with a person  you take notes and say  that really could be a goal  It took a while to realize this wasn t just another boring thing we needed to sit through  Provided a lot more in depth information","One of the purposes of the tool to inform person centered planning tool goal setting and identifying information for individual","I like the SIS in terms of capturing data ","As a SD Coordinator in our county  we talk a lot about the SIS  We re really interested in the level of data that it gets at ","When I know that the SIS is going to be compiled and go to money makers  at least there s people who are open to it with children with DD  there s people at the local level that can allocate resources in a more independent way better outlook for economy ","Global perspective this is helping to know in the future where resources are going to go  Connecting needs with funneling money in those directions supportive employment  Self D ","My other life is contract management monitoring  I m thinking this could be useful when we assess  gee is our paneled providers sufficient to meet the needs in this area","I d like to see an assessment that can do both measure core experience for individual  but also provide data to operationalize  do thing to support families  members  and core needs for our finances  funding  quality mechanisms ","Two people could get a mild MR diagnosis  and they could come out very differently using the SIS ","We use it as a talking point to talk about prioritizing our HAB Support Waiver spots  Isn t end all  but helps us to prioritize","Information used as a discussion point when prioritizing HSW waiver slots for the Region ","In the beginning  they used to do SIS for all new intakes  and it was extremely helpful for SC s  but went away from it ","For new supports coordinators  SIS would be helpful  When I ve known them over 10 years  I can probably help the assessor out ","If a new case manager comes on  and they have to understand their entire caseload they ve been tasked with  they can start to understand them better with access to thorough assessments","I ve explained it that it s something that we like to do as soon as we get a new consumer in  With new people  I tell them it s a great opportunity for them to have a breakdown of what kinds of supports they need  and how we can help them by understand a better picture of the whole person

<li id="fn2"><p>While people from multiple roles and areas across the system were in attendance, there was a relatively low turn-out for individuals served and their family members. As the focus groups were intended to be the primary means of gathering personal feedback from persons served and their families, in lieu of the more formal survey, there is substantial value in continuing to engage people receiving services in discussions related to the uses of assessment data.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>The list of potential uses of the data which were included as response options in the survey questions were originally identified by practitioners in the field and subsequently reviewed by MDHHS-BHDDA<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>The labels in the chart shown here are summaries of the text of the question from the survey. To see a more detailed explanation of each, you can hover above the chart or look up the related explanation in the appendix.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>While the survey clearly asked respondents “How could the data from the SIS® assessment <em>help you to perform your role</em>?”, it is not clear that individuals consistently responded with this guidance in mind. Thus, a number of respondents indicated using the assessment for a purpose which clearly falls outside the scope of their role. Furthermore, the feedback from focus groups was not captured as structured data in a way that the specific type of use to be tied to a specific role. For this reason we have not structured the subsequent sections by role.<a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>This is a common challenge with the implementation and diffusion of any change, which is impacted by aspects of the innovation itself, communication related to the change, time, and a social system which supports use of the innovation.<a href="#fnref6">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Of particular relevance here is the work of the economist Elinor Ostrom, whose work providing practical pointers for managing common resources, such as: <em>(a) defining clear group boundaries, (b) matching rules governing use of common goods to specific needs and conditions, (c) making sure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying them where possible, (d) developing a system which allows community members to monitoring other members’ behavior, (e) providing accessible, low-cost means for resolving disputes</em>.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a></p></li>

<li id="fn11"><p>For instance, people acknowledged that multiple resources had been made available during the initial roll-out of the assessment. One respondent noted that: <em>“The Department had trainers around the area, so there were presentations…there were quite a few of those”</em> Nevertheless, a number of individuals were not aware of these resources and therefore noted a lack of clarity in messaging.<a href="#fnref11">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>See, for instance: Renwick, T. (2015, April 13). Michigan Supports Intensity Scale (SIS) Implementation (Letter to PIHP Executive Directors). This letter clarified that <em>“as with all assessments, the SIS is voluntary… Supports and services cannot be denied, reduced or discontinued if a consumer and/or the guardian refuse to cooperate with the assessment process.”</em><a href="#fnref12">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Please note that the focus of this paper treats the process of the assessment only to the extent that it impacts the interpretation of the resulting dataset or the willingness of the broader system to use the data. This is not an evaluation of the content of training about how the tool should be implemented, but a summary of feedback from stakeholders about how they have experienced it.<a href="#fnref13">↩</a></p></li>
