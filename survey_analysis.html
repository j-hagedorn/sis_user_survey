<div id="what-is-this-report-about" class="section level1">
<h1>What is this report about?</h1>
<p>The Supports Intensity Scale (SIS®) is a standardized assessment tool implemented by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) for all Medicaid-eligible persons 18 and older who have intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDD) and who are currently receiving case management or supports coordination or respite-only services through the behavioral health system. Use of the tool began in July of 2014 and by September 30th of 2017 the intent is for all eligible individuals to have received an assessment.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the completion of this initial implementation phase, MDHHS sought feedback from people receiving services and supports, their family members, advocates, prepaid inpatient health plan (PIHP) employees, community mental health (CMH) agencies and service providers regarding current and potential uses of the data from the SIS® assessment tool.</p>
<p>This document is a summary of the feedback they received.</p>

<div id="focus-groups" class="section level2">
<h2>Focus Groups</h2>
<p>A series of focus groups were scheduled throughout the state for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, their family members, and their Supports Coordinators/Case Managers. The purpose of these focus groups was to understand people’s current use of data from the SIS® and to understand peoples feedback how the data might be used to inform the Person-Centered Planning process, ensuring that individuals receive supports and services according to their needs. Four focus groups were offered at locations throughout the state (<em>in Detroit, Petoskey, Kalamazoo, and Mount Pleasant</em>) to reach a broad audience and minimize travel time for attendees.</p>

<div id="survey" class="section level2">
<h2>Survey</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SIS_USER_EXPERIENCE_SURVEY">A survey</a> was developed using <em>Survey Monkey</em> and sent by MDHHS staff via e-mail to each of the following groups on 2/1/2017:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advocates and Advocacy Organizations</li>
<li>Habilitation Support Waiver Leads</li>
<li>SIS® Assessors and Quality Leads</li>
<li>CEOs of CMHSP agencies (<em>for distribution to IDD staff</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A reminder e-mail was distributed on 3/14/17 in advance of the closing of the survey on 3/17/17.</p>

<p>By far, the largest role represented in the responses is Supports Coordinator (n = 222), followed by directors of programs for IDD (n = 68) and SIS assessors (n = 28). All other roles had fewer than 10 responses. Since Supports Coordinators are a crucial part of helping to translate an individual’s assessed needs into a dialogue to inform person-centered planning and eventually authorizations for services, it is encouraging to have such a strong response in this area.</p>

<p>A quick look at the responses shows that the most common use of SIS® data is to inform the individual plan of service (IPOS) and related tasks. This is not surprising, given the large number of responses from Supports Coordinators</p>
<p><strong>Current uses of data by role</strong></p>
<p>What percentage of respondents in each role is currently performing each use? In the visual below, a darker blue means that a higher percent of respondents indicated they were currently using SIS data for a particular purpose.</p>

<h1>How could the data be used?</h1>
<p>Knowing how respondents are already using the data is helpful, yet it may reflect only a few of the full range of potential uses for this data. The chart below shows the proportion of respondents who indicated that a particular use of the data would be relevant for their role</p>
<p>Indeed, it is likely that many potential uses were not even listed in the survey responses. As with any resource, people will use data for ingenious and unpredictable purposes. For this reason, it is important that there be principles to guide the use of this data across the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="guiding-principles" class="section level1">
<h1>Guiding principles</h1>
<p>While there are some basic ethical principles guiding the use of this data for any purpose, one of the guiding principles of the questions we asked was that uses of the data should be defined by role. For instance, while we may not want a supports coordinator using SIS data by itself to determine medical necessity for services at the individual level, it may be entirely appropriate for a provider network manager to use the same data to explore whether there are enough services in a given area to meet the needs of the entire population served. The <em>role</em> which is using the data matters.</p>
